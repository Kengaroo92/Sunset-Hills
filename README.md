# Sunset Hills Coding Challenge
Sunset Hills is a coding challenge that is intended to assess the programmers ability to work with Arrays. It will have an input field that provides an array of buildings. The numbers input in the fields determine the heights of the buildings. The sun shines from the left side and determines which buildings are able to see the sunset. 

Technologies used to write this simple program are, HTML and CSS using the Bootstrap framework for the UI, and JavaScript and jQuery for the functionality.
